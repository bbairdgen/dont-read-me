  ## Description
  
  This README was created using the code within the files in this repo. I created this project to quickly create professional style README files. I learned how to call functions correctly from a different file. I also learned how to pass information from the Inquirer option directly into the functions in a separate file.

  ## Installation

  ## Usage
  
  Navigate to the file in Command Line and then run "node index.js". This will then give you some prompts, which you will need to answer. Once all of the prompts are answered, a new README.md file will be created in the same folder location as the "index.js". If you run the program again without moving the new file, it will overwrite the file. Any images you want to use need to be added after the generator has run. The following gif was added after this file was created using the generator.

  ## Credits
  
  To create this file, I used the starter code provided by the BootCamp. To better understand how to use two files to create this generator, I watched a YouTube video from the user Assistian. I also read through different posts on  www.stackoverflow.com. For the links to the different licenses I used a GitHub Gist created by user lukas-h in the repo license-badbges.md.
